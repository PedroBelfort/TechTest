# WordPuzzle

## Problem

- Select a start word, for example, *same*.
- Choose an end word, for example, *cost*.
- Develop a list of words that transition from the start word to the end word.
- Only one letter can change between any two words.
- Each intermediate step must be a valid word from the provided dictionary file.

**Example:**
**S**AME => **C**AME => CA**S**E => CAS**T** => C**O**ST

## Solution Steps

**SAME** => **COST**

1. From the start word (*SAME*), generate a list containing all valid words from the dictionary, changing only one character at a time. This list is named *wordList*.

    ```
    wordList = [tame, name, dame, lame, game, came, fame, some, sane, sale, sage, sake, safe, save]
    ```

2. Filter the *wordList* to find the word closest to the end word using the [***Levenshtein Distance***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) algorithm, imported from the [*LevenshteinDistance* library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LevenshteinDistance/1.0.0) . The word closest to the end word is named *bestWord*.

    ```
    bestWord = came
    ```

3. Add *bestWord* to the list of intermediate words between the start word and the end word.
4. Update the start word with the value of *bestWord*.
5. Repeat the cycle until one of the following conditions is met:
   - A) The start word equals the end word, then return the list of intermediate words between startWord and endWord.
   - B) While it is possible to create a *wordList* of possible words. When no possible words are found to continue the loop, add "No intermediate word found" and end the loop.
  

## App Functions
 ***-The application loads the 'words-english.txt' file upon startup  inside Assets folder***  

1 - The application operates as a console application that prompts the user to input the start word, end word and the file name.<br>
![read inputs](https://github.com/PedroBelfort/TechTest/blob/main/WordPuzzle/Assets/step-1.png)  <br>

2 - Upon receiving the inputs, the app processes them and prints the intermediate words on the console. Additionally, it exports a solution file (solution.txt) to the Desktop. <br>

3 - The solution file is exported to the Desktop. <br>

4 - The user can exit the application at any time by typing "bye".
![bye](https://github.com/PedroBelfort/TechTest/blob/main/WordPuzzle/Assets/step4.png)  <br>

5 - The user can clear the application's data at any time by typing "clear".

6- When no intermediate word is found, the application prints "No intermediate word found".
![not found](https://github.com/PedroBelfort/TechTest/blob/main/WordPuzzle/Assets/step-6.png)  <br>

7 - The application throws an exception when a business rule is violated.

## Solution Packages

The solution contains two projects:

**A) WordPuzzle** (Console Application project, .NET 8)
   - LevenshteinDistance Version="1.0.0"
   - Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection Version="8.0.0"
   
**B) WordPuzzle.UnitTests** (Xunit, .NET 8)
   - coverlet.collector Version="6.0.0"
   - FluentAssertions Version="6.12.0"
   - Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk Version="17.8.0"
   - Moq Version="4.20.70"
   - xunit Version="2.5.3"
   - xunit.runner.visualstudio Version="2.5.3"

## Solution Structure

**WordPuzzle** is split into 5 different folders and 2 files Program.cs and WordPuzzleAppRunner:

- **Assets**: Holds the words-english.txt file used as a dictionary for the solution and the Readme image files.
- **Configurations**: Holds the ServiceConfigurator.cs class, responsible for Dependency Injection registration.
- **Exception**: Holds the personalized exceptions used in the project.
- **Interfaces**: Holds the contracts used in the project.
- **Services**: Holds the contract implementations.
- **Program.cs**: Responsible for initializing the Dependency Injection container and running the application.
- **WordPuzzleAppRunner**: Holds the solution flow, working as a controller.

**WordPuzzle.UnitTests**: This project has only one folder Services.Tests that holds the unit tests for the services implementations.

## Development history 

Upon initially assessing the problem description, I mistakenly assumed it would be straightforward to resolve. I proceeded by creating a console project and drafting a pseudo-algorithm to tackle the issue. This initial approach, documented in the early commits of the development history, appeared to address simpler cases effectively. However, upon implementing the solution in a single class within a structured solution, I realized its limitationsâ€”it only worked for basic scenarios, and there was no assurance that all dictionary word possibilities had been thoroughly tested.

Subsequently, I delved into research on determining word proximity and came across the Levenshtein Distance algorithm, conveniently available for use through a C# library. Integrating the Levenshtein Distance algorithm into my solution significantly expedited the process. This integration led to the creation of the initial version with a structured solution, denoted by the 1.0.0 tag.

Shortly afterward, I devoted myself to refactoring the solution, embracing SOLID principles and refining console input handling. This refinement process resulted in subsequent versions marked by the 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 tags.
